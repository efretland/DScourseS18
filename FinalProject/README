To execute this project:

Access the collected 3rd down data from this link 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t92PiIVipoeDt-ijd6RoHIWu-esVm8TdDplZXDRAJxY/edit?usp=sharing
and save it to your local machine. 

This is the only place the data is available, as it was collected specifically for this project.

Once the data is saved to a local machine, change the relevant filename and working directory information in the R file and it should be ready to run.
